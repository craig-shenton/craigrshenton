It helps me to organise my thoughts, maximise my impact and reflect on my learnings. Yet, I have consistently not prioritised writing and it is a disservice to myself that I have not made set aside time for deliberate practice.\nI have started and abandoned more blogs than I can remember, so I always start a new blogging project with some apprehension. But, as mentioned above, writing is too important for me to not try again.\nHere’s to another shot at this. Wish me luck!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy visualisation of Hello world + Quarto logo"

Just following this alone will get you started with a perfectly beautiful and functional blog. \nHowever, your blog is also your personal slice out on the internet, and if you can add just a tad bit of your personality into the content, it makes it more enjoyable for your readers. Here are my favourite tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile it is fun to add these bells and whistles, do not lose focus on the most important part of your blog - the content."

I’m allowed to sit at my desk, I’m allowed to stare out at the world, I’m allowed to do anything I like, as long as it isn’t anything. Not allowed to do a crossword, not allowed to read a book, not allowed to phone a friend, not allowed to make a clay model of something. All I’m allowed to do is absolutely nothing, or write.\n\nFor a couple of years now, I have adapted a version of this exercise to help me complete my learning projects. Every year I make the grand announcement that this will be the year of X. Where X is a learning topic or a new programming language that I wish to focus on.\n\n\nI declared this my year of Scala all the way back in Jan, but I only started this blog in July, which is why this post is published in September 😅.\n\n\n\n🎉 2022 year is my year of Scala! 🎉\n\n\nInspired by Neil’s rules, my rules for this year are:\n\nFor every project that requires coding, I am going to try and use Scala\nBut, I give myself permission to not use Scala if it is just not the right option for my use case\nHowever, I do not have permission to try out any other shiny new programming language I might be tempted by"

Stow is a symlink manager that when coupled with any version control software (ie. git) can create a simple and effective config sync system. I have used such a system for the last couple of months and is something I can no longer live without.\n\n\nWhen you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a functionWhen you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post\n\n— David Robinson (@drob) November 9, 2017\n\n\nI find myself bringing up Stow pretty often in conversations so I wanted to take @drob’s advice. However, as there are many excellent blogs that already do a great job explaining what Stow is, I think I can’t add much value to that conversation. Instead, I’m going to shift my energy toward creating a straightforward how-to recipe."

    "text": "Design is not just what it looks like an feels like. Design is how it works. – Steve Jobs\n\nIn my previous post, I created some digital art by trying to replicate an existing piece of art. That was a pretty fun exercise which stimulated a lot of my thoughts about the process of building visualisations.\nSo, as fun project for this post, I have decided to try and collect/recrete/riff on several visualisations for experimentation. In doing so, I aim to improve my understanding how experiment visualisations and try to think of the best ways to present the key messages. As I shared on my [post about creating digital art], I am taking a course on d3.js, so that is the tool I’ll use for this project."

    "text": "The Upworthy Research Archive\nLet me take this opportunity to introduce a rather fascinating dataset for our little exercise. The Upworthy Research Archive is an open dataset showcasing thousands of experiments conducted by Upworthy.com. Each row in this dataset represents a package, which is a variant of a test. A package contains a unique headline and image combination, and records the aggregated impressions and clicks from the random group of users who were exposed to this package. A test consist of multiple packages jointly identified by a common clickability_test_id.\n\n\n\nExample of 4 packages with different headlines and images in the same test. Source: Prof. Matias’s Lecture\n\n\n\n\nDo Headlines matter?\nOne can imagine the key question these experiments are trying to answer is “Does changing an article’s headline or image, meaningfully improve user engagement?”\n\n\nCode\nupworthy <- read_csv(\"upworthy-archive-confirmatory-packages-03.12.2020.csv\")\n\n\nHere is an example of single test in the upworthy dataset, where 4 subtly different headlines are shown to random groups of users.\nWell, that’s where Infer comes in.\n\n\nIf your curiousity is piqued by what the “answer to the poignant question” is, here’s a link to upworthy article\n\n\nCode\nupworthy %>% \n    filter(clickability_test_id == \"527c5cdaf54181002d005141\") %>%\n    select(headline, impressions, clicks) %>%\n    gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      headline\n      impressions\n      clicks\n    \n  \n  \n    See That Girl From The Hunger Games Respond To A Poignant Question\n15858\n498\n    That Girl From The Hunger Games Is Asked A Poignant Question, And I Love Her Answer\n16210\n625\n    That Girl From The Hunger Games Responds To A Question In Such A Poignant Way\n15549\n504\n    See The Girl From The Hunger Games Respond To A Poignant Question In A Wonderful Way\n17582\n566\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can assume that for each headline variant, an equal group of users would be tagged as eligible to be exposed to the headline. However, running a live experiment on live users with different browsing patterns (and other factors associated with a modern web application), contribute to a different number of impressions served for each variant. Notably, we also record a different number of clicks users made on the article.\nClearly, there are headlines that achieve higher clicks per impressions compared to the other variants in the same test, but how do we know if this increase is not just coming random variance?\nLet’s use Infer to take a swing at answering such questions.\n\n\nWhat is the baseline click per impression rate?\n\n\nCode\nupworthy %>% \n    select(impressions, clicks) %>%\n    mutate(clicks_per_imp = clicks/impressions)\n\n\n# A tibble: 105,550 × 3\n   impressions clicks clicks_per_imp\n         <dbl>  <dbl>          <dbl>\n 1        3118      8        0.00257\n 2        4587    130        0.0283 \n 3        3017     19        0.00630\n 4        2974     26        0.00874\n 5        3050     10        0.00328\n 6        3061     20        0.00653\n 7        2997     20        0.00667\n 8        2959     29        0.00980\n 9        3086     16        0.00518\n10        3068     16        0.00522\n# … with 105,540 more rows\n\n\nWe have a sizeable dataset of ~100,000 rows sdasd\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{tan2022,\n  author = {Daniel Tan},\n  editor = {},\n  title = {Hypothesis Testing with {Tidymodel’s} {Infer}},\n  date = {2022-11-21},\n  url = {https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/inferUpworthy},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDaniel Tan. 2022. “Hypothesis Testing with Tidymodel’s\nInfer.” November 21, 2022. https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/inferUpworthy."

Advent of code is a free-to-join daily coding puzzle project that starts on 1 Dec and concludes on the 25th. Each day a two-part question is released on the site to test your problem-solving skills. Many programmers all around the world enjoy solving these puzzles together in a variety of programming languages. This year, being my Year of Scala, it should come as no surprise that I plan on using Scala as my language of choice!\n\n\nAmongst the many different programming languages used for AOC, I am always impressed by the mavericks who choose to use Excel 🤯\n\n\n\nSource: https://thenewstack.io/advent-of-codes-programming-puzzles-set-new-global-record/\n\n\n\n\n\nAn amazing resource we have to prepare for this year’s AOC are the examples and solutions provided by Scala Center for last year’s AOC - Scala Center Solutions to 2021 Advent of Code. Here you can find a variety of solutions using solely Scala’s standard library and showcasing how to best use idiomatic Scala to solve common problems. In this post, I am going to share is a summary of my tips and takeaways."

I can sincerely share that I found more ideas to bring back to try at my work from this conference than any previous conference I have attended.\n\nThe conference was held in a single day, split between 3 sessions and several lightning talks. Each session had about 10 speakers covering a variety of topics. All of these are available for free on NormConf’s youtube channel.\nI spent the weekend catching up on all the talks and wanted to share a couple of my favourites:"

Guenia’s talk is useful for anyone who would not only like to be more aware of pitfalls to avoid, but also to better understand the implications for each Spark command you invoke.\nIf you are new to Spark, give Guenia’s Spark crash course at 2:40 a watch!

Efficient simulation for everyday ML decisions by Julia Silge\nWhereas most of the other talks I’ve shared thus far are broadly inpsirational and entertaining, Julia’s talk is something I could bring directly back to my everyday work. Julia’s talk approaches a question that many new data science learners have but is hard to answer - When performing cross validation, how many folds is too many? And while Julia devotes a good amount of time approaching that question, what her talk really illustrates is how do you break down a question and empirically approach a solution via simulation.\n\n\n…unless you cop out with an answer like “it depends” 🙄\nSimulation is such a powerful tool that goes beyond just the introduction of resampling and bootstraps. Simulation is a paradigm that empowers you to structure your belief of how a system works explicitly as a model, and validate those assumptions with real data. I have found so many areas of my work where approaching the thorny problem through the lens of simulation has clarified my understanding of viable solutions.\nIf you have only time for 1 talk, this would be my recommendation."

    "text": "It’s the start of the new year, which means I’m committing to a new learning theme for the year! I’ve found that having a single learning theme for the whole year helps keep me focused and prevents me from getting too excited about exploring new topics. It also helps me make both short- and long-term plans without stressing myself out too much, since I’m juggling my independent learning with time for my family, work, and school. As I mentioned in my post about my learning theme for 2022, my goal is to find the right balance.\nThis year, I’m focusing on Causal Inference! 🎊 🥳 🎊 🥳 🎊 🥳"

    "text": "What is Causal Inference?\nIf you’ve taken a statistics class or worked in the data industry, you’ve probably heard this warning: “Correlation does not imply causation!” While this is definitely true, I’ve always wondered, “Well, what does imply causation?”\n\n\n\nxkcd never gets old\n\n\nWhen we use correlation and other measurements of association in our machine learning models, we end up with a good understanding of dependence. ML models are great at identifying patterns that link our features to outcomes, which is why they can make such accurate predictions. But even with these accurate predictions, we may not always have a clear understanding of the complex cause-and-effect forces at play in the system.\nThat’s where causal inference comes in. It’s the study of these cause-and-effect forces – not just being able to predict future outcomes, but also understanding which factors contribute and how."

    "text": "Why did I choose Causal Inference?\n\nCausal Inference can answer questions classic Experimentation theory cannot\nAt work, I’m often involved in designing online experiments using randomized control trials (also known as A/B tests), which are considered the gold standard for gathering causal inferences. But RCTs aren’t always feasible – sometimes the question we’re trying to answer requires a longer timeline, or it might be unethical to test (like the effects of smoking).\nOutside of the clean data we get from RCTs, there’s a wealth of observational data from field experiments, surveys, and logs that we can use to draw causal inferences. There are so many interesting questions that we can generate looking at these data and causal inference could provide me new tools to my statistical toolkit to answer them.\n\n\nCausal Inference is relatable to everyone\nSecond, causal inference is something that’s relevant to everyone. We all make a ton of decisions every day – from what to have for breakfast to whether we need to take an umbrella with us. A lot of these decisions are influenced by our understanding of the causal forces at play in our lives. I believe that, with the right set of skills, we can “play the hand we’re dealt” as best we can, even if we can’t change the circumstances we were born into.\n\n\nThere is a resurgence of materials to help one learn Causal Inference\nFinally, there’s been a resurgence of materials on causal inference lately, starting with the Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to proponents of the field in 2021. There are more resources available now than ever before to help people learn about causal inference, which makes it a great time to dive in."

    "section": "Plan for the Year",
    "text": "Plan for the Year\nHere is my collection of study materials that I plan on using this year:\n\nStructured Courses\nStructured or semi-structured courses with assignments and projects are my favourite format for learning. I found Coursera’s Essential Causal Inference Techniques for Data Science . This looks to be a straight-forward, short introduction to causal inference techniques to survey the landscape.\n\n\nMaterials that come with a community\nThese are the primary resources I plan to use, particularly because these are all resources that facilitate a community of learners either by providing a study group or video lectures. This is important to me because I enjoy have this community to learn with and learn from.\nScott Cunningham’s Causal Inference Mixtape is the single most recommended material on Causal Inference. You can read the free online copy or support the Prof. Cunningham by purchasing a print copy (links on the home page). Last year, Ravin Kumar organised a Causal Inference Book Club, so there is a lively community of online discussions and youtube videos to study along side with.\nRichard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking is perhaps my favourite textbook of all time. While this material is more often billed as an introduction to Bayesian statistics, I have always found a lot of the central themes align with the pursuit of causality. The printed copy needs to be purchased but Prof. McElreath provides free recordings of his lectures on youtube. 2023’s lectures just began this month.\n\n\nWhat do you mean it’s not a thing to have a “favourite textbook”?! Everyone has one, right? Right?\nMatheus Facure’s Causal Inference for the Brave and True is another material that is on the top of many recommendations. The above 2 recommendations primarily have their code examples in R, so Matheus’s alternative with Python examples fits a nice gap. Matheus is also working on an O’Reilly book Causal Inference in Python which I am eagerly waiting for.\nNick Huntington-Klien’s The Effect Book rounds up my list of recommended materials. The Effect Book is a comprehensive dive into causal inference paired with research design, and Dr. Huntington-Klien even includes an accompanying free Youtube video series along with homework assignments and source code to learn from. The online version of the book is free and you can purchase the print copy from links on its home page.\n\n\nMaterials for solo studying and referencing\nThis is a shorter list of materials that do not come with a ready online community. These are more traditional academic textbooks that I plan to peruse occasionally when referencing a gnarly topic.\n\nElements of Causal Inference\nField Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation\nIntroductory Econometrics A Modern Approach"

    "text": "Learning by doing\nThis is a rough draft of the type of projects I can do during this year to complement my learning.\n\nCausal Inference Projects\nI plan to work my way up from simple notebooks and exercises illustrating the usage of one of the many causal inference libraries. Eventually, being able to complete a larger analysis more akin to the type of problems I hope to address at work. I would like the opportunity to try out several different libraries from a variety of programming languages, if applicable. I bookmarked Emily Riederer’s blog on Causal Design Patterns for Data Analysts for reference, and I hope to be able to implement each of the patterns she describes by the end of the year.\n\n\nLearning about the Causal Inference landscape\nCausal Inference is a broad umbrella comprising of many professionals from a wide swathe of disciplines. Besides learning the technical methodologies, I would like to learn more about the academics, educators and practitioners that make up its global community. Prof. Cunningham also records a podcast interviewing several causal inference experts. It might be a nice break from studying to allocate some time to listen to their stories and write a few summary posts on my blog.\n\n\nBlogging\nWhich brings me to this blog! Last year, I started this blog and published 8 blog articles. I aim to publish 12 this year (mostly about Causal Inference) and share with you the learnings along my journey."
